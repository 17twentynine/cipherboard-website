When we talk about CipherBoard in this policy, we are talking about CipherBoard Pte Ltd, the company, CipherBoard, the downloadable application, and the CipherBoard website at <a href="http://www.cipherboard.com">www.cipherboard.com</a>. CipherBoard is available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device.</p><p>This policy describes how CipherBoard treats your information, not how other organizations treat your information. If you are using CipherBoard in a workplace or on a device or any application or account issued to you by your employer or another organization, that company or organization likely has its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, and retention of communications and content which may affect your use of CipherBoard. CipherBoard guarantees that the data generated from the service and shared from CipherBoard to any application or service will be secure and will not be accessible by the host application or service. Moreover, <strong>CipherBoard itself will not have any access to your data nor does it ever leave the device</strong>. In some communication applications, interactions (not data just interactions with use of CipherBoard) that would otherwise be considered private to you or to a limited group of people may, in some cases, be accessible by your Team Owner or administrator. Please check with your employer, Team Owner or administrator about the policies it has in place regarding your communications and related content on CipherBoard. More on this below.</p><h4>Information we DO NOT collect OR receive</h4>Communication content that you send and receive with CipherBoard. This includes:<ul><li>The message content itself. This content can include messages, pictures, files and video among other types of files.</li><li>When messages or files were sent and by whom, when or if they were seen by you, and where you received them (in a channel or application or direct message, for example).</li></ul><h4>Information we collect and receive</h4><p>We collect different kinds of information. Some of it is personally identifiable and some is non-identifying or aggregated. Here are the types of information we collect or receive:</p><ul><li>Contact information. When you give access to mobile contacts or Facebook on CipherBoard, we collect your email address or mobile-number or facebook-id, your contacts, your user name that appears in your CipherBoard, and password. In future: CipherBoard domain (ex: your-name.cipherboard.com)</li><li>Account and profile information. The only information we require to create your CipherBoard account is an email address and password. Alternatively, only your mobile-number or Facebook-id. Optional information you can enter into your profile includes information such as your first and last name, profile-photo, and your phone number. Any information you add to your profile is visible to other people on your contacts, this will be described on your profile management page (coming soon).</li><li>Log data. When you use CipherBoard, our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you’re using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before coming to CipherBoard, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data.</li><li>Log data does not contain message content and is not routinely deleted.</li><li>Device information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using CipherBoard on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.</li><li>CipherBoard usage information. This is just information about which people, features, and links you interact with within CipherBoard.</li><li>Information from partners or other 3rd parties. CipherBoard may receive information from partners or others that we could use to make our own information better or more useful. This might be aggregate level information about which IP addresses go with which zip codes or it might be more specific information about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed. These are primarily used for our marketing and user-acquisition efforts and are not intended for any other purposes.</li></ul><h4>Our Cookie Policy</h4><p>CipherBoard uses cookies, or similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.<br>Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer to us, each time you visit our website. They are unique to your CipherBoard account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.<br>Some cookies are associated with your CipherBoard account and personal information to remember that you are logged in and which teams you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your CipherBoard account but are unique and allow us to do site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access CipherBoard through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable all cookies you may not be able to use CipherBoard.<br>CipherBoard sets and accesses our own cookies on our company-owned domains. In addition, we use 3rd parties like Google Analytics, Intercom, Unbounce and Mixpanel for website analytics. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p><h4>How we use your information</h4><p>We use your information for the following:</p><ul><li>Providing the CipherBoard service. We use information you provide to authenticate you and deliver message content to you and from you</li><li>Understanding and improving our products. To make the product better we must understand how users are using it. We have a fair bit of data about usage and we intend to use it many ways to improve our products, including research. This policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with usage data that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer tied to a CipherBoard user.</li><li>Investigating and preventing bad stuff from happening. We work hard to keep CipherBoard secure and to prevent abuse and fraud.</li><li>Communicating with you<ul><li>Solving your problems and responding to your requests. If you contact us with a problem or question, we will use your information to respond to that request and address your problems or concerns.</li><li>Email messages. We may send you service and administrative emails, such as when we notice that you are nearing a message or integration limit. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our services, our service offerings and important service related notices, such as changes to this policy or security and fraud notices. These messages are considered part of the service and you may not opt-out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails to CipherBoard users about new product features or other news about CipherBoard. You can opt-out of these at any time.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Message Retention Settings</h4><p>CipherBoard does not offer any options for message retention and export to any user.</p><h4>Other Choices</h4><ul><li>The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage.</li><li>Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us. CipherBoard <strong>does not</strong> control these choices, or default settings, which are offered by makers of your browser or mobile device.</li></ul><h4>Sharing and Disclosure</h4><p>There are times when communications and related content and other user information may be shared by CipherBoard. This section discusses only how CipherBoard may share user information. Organizations that use CipherBoard may have their own policies for sharing and disclosure of information they can access through CipherBoard. CipherBoard may share information:</p><ul><li>With consent, to comply with legal process, or to protect CipherBoard and our users. When we have your consent or if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or CipherBoard; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. If we receive a law enforcement or other third party request for information we will provide prior notice to the subject of the request where we are legally permitted to do so.</li><li>With third party service providers and agents. We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at preventing unauthorized access or with an email vendor to send messages on our behalf. We may also share data with hosting providers, payment processors, marketing vendors, and other consultants who work on our behalf.</li></ul><h4>Security</h4><p>CipherBoard takes every reasonable steps to protect information you provide to us as part of your use of the CipherBoard service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. When you enter sensitive information (such as sign-in credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no electronic or email transmission or digital storage mechanism is ever fully secure or error free.</p><h4>Children’s information</h4><p>CipherBoard is not directed to children under 8. We are taking some extra measures to enhance this family experience across our product.</p><h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4><p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use CipherBoard after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are material, we may provide more prominent notice or seek your consent to the new policy.</p><h4>Contacting CipherBoard</h4><p>Please also feel free to contact us if you have any questions about CipherBoard ’s Privacy Policy or practices.
